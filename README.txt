The Ultimaker Firmware Hacker Workspace
=========================================

A eclipse workspace for easy hacking on the Ultimaker RepRap Firmware and related libraries.

Setup
-------

1) Download Eclipse C/C++ Edition from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/heliossr2 
2) Download Eclipse AVR following the instructions at http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Plugin_Download
3) Git clone this repository
4) Startup eclipse using this repository as the workspace folder.

Magically you now have all the Ultimaker src and libs at your disposal! If you have any problems with git I recommend reading up on gitsubmodule.. it can be a bit weird at first.


happy hacking,

Rob
